**Constrained Optimization**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Maximize multivariate function :math:`f(x, y) = x^2y` on the set :math:`x^2 + y^2 = 1` (unit circle)`
The set is a subset of the x,y plane. Looking on projected circle onto the 3d graph. :math:`z= x^2y`


**Lagrange Multipliers**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Constrained optimization can be solved using tangents.
E.g. Maximize :math:`f(x, y) = x^2y subject to x^2 + y^2 = 1`
f(x, y) can be varied based on input x,y, idea is f(x,y) is maximized when tangent to circle formed by bounds.
